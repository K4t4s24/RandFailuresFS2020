# About

Randomize in-flight failures and check if you can detect them, handle them and survive. From minor panel or turbocharger failure to complete brakes or engine failures.
You can try what would you do in case of
- Asymmetric flaps
- Gear failure
- Coolant leaks
- and more

In the field next to the name of the failure, you can enter the percentage chance of a failure in the range from 0% to 100%. Where 0% means that tere will be no failure, and 100% means that failure will occur.
Failure will occur in one of four moments (which you can turn on or off) :
- instantly
- on takeoff
- after random set of secconds
- at random altitide
